# attendenceManagement
Working on this new project to ease the process of getting to know the servlet and JSP relation..
By employing the core OOPS's concepts and programming the connection between them. I have used JAVA, JDBC and servlet for backend and
HTML+CSS,Bootstrape 4, and javascript working as Frontend and to perform database operation i have chosen MySQL WorkBench. Hoping to add many methods and functionality to this project to make it interactive, Interseting ,and useful to streamline the process of managing attendance of Students and Faculty.
